# Solitaire

This is a web app which I made for my mom as a christmas gift, since she likes playing this game.

I'll keep developing this app, but will do so on my own.
Features can only be suggested by my mom.
UX will be tailored to my mom's need's as well.

The app is hosted on: https://solitare-division-by-zero.netlify.app

# Usage

The app can be started locally using the following command:

```
npm run start
```

# Notes

I suck at design, so I borrowed some ideas from other sources:

- Card SVG's are from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck#SVG
- The logo is AI generated (I'm sorry artists)
- original game design is some random solitare app on the google play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemongame.klondike.solitaire

Note that my mom only speaks German.
So language support for any other language is propably not feasable right now.
